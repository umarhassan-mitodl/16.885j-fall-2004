  "course_title": "Aircraft Systems Engineering",
  "course_description": "Aircraft are complex products comprised of many subsystems which must meet demanding customer and operational lifecycle value requirements. This course adopts a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic systems engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance; safety and reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and management; and system realization. Small\u00a0student teams \"retrospectively analyze\" an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions; aircraft attributes and subsystems; and\u00a0operational experience. Finally, the student teams\u00a0deliver\u00a0oral and written versions of the case study.\n",
