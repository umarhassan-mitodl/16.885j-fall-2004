Due to the holistic nature of this subject, sources of information are many and varied.

SMEs
----

Each team will have a Subject Matter Expert (SME) who is involved in the early design phases and decisions for the case study aircraft.

Case Studies
------------

Case studies from last year are available for reference. Teams are encouraged to use them as models for this semester's case studies. Since last year was the initial offering of the subject, the case studies should be viewed as a "first generation" example. Each one is somewhat different.

Lecture Sources
---------------

Individual lectures may contain reference sources pertinent to that particular topic.

Additional Resources
--------------------

Each team will have to search for and locate sources of information pertinent to their particular aircraft. The SME, the worldwide Web, technical literature, and the course faculty are all resources to utilize.
